                      <!-- /wp:video --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Did the first real 4x4 test of Sprinter today. Didn't get video of the real gnarly parts, but it handled the off camber mud and steep hills like a champ. The suspension is a bit stiffer than I'd like through the twisty stuff, but the independent braking does a great job sending power to the other wheels when one comes off the ground. (Which is easy to do given the it's designed for making deliveries, not crossing huge ditches). Got the first few scratches on it too, but why own a 4x4 if your not going to use it amiright?

  I promise more videos in the future in places where no delivery van should ever go ;.
