I eeked out a 2.5km walk/run that was pain free, albiet a little strange feeling. This injury has been frustrating, but I'm looking at it as an opportunity to improve myself. To become more patient. To slow down. To appreciate the moment. To be happy with everything I've accomplished so far. To be more vigilant and realize that injuries happen in the "safest" of places if you become complacent. While this was an unplanned break from training, I hope it's made me a better person and athlete in the long term.
