Sometimes it knocks me out for hours, days, or at its worst, weeks. It's hard to talk about. It's hard to admit. It feels like a weakness, a vulnerability (it's not). Like others who live with it, I'm an expert at hiding it (I've had a lifetime of practice). But I'm glad on #LetsTalk day, people are opening up about this issue. Because it's nice to know that we're not fighting these battles alone. If you've been suffering in silence, I encourage you to open up even if it's to one person. There are more of us out there than you think. #bellletstalk</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->"
