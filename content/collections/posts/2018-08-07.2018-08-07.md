  I haven't felt much like running lately. I'm not sure why. The same thing happened last summer.. Too many races? Summer smoke? Heat? Family worries?

  All I know is I have a 70mi race in 4 days that I'm not prepared for at *all* (physically but especially mentally). So probably won't be at the start line. But I'm oddly at peace with that option, although if the past is any indicator, I'll feel like I let myself down when the race updates start coming in.

  The trick to getting through races and efforts of this magnitude often involve pushing yourself past what most consider "normal." Even after four years I still haven't figured out when I'm on the unhealthy side of that threshold. There is still much learning here.

  Sometimes you need to listen to your body, and more importantly your mind.

  I'm not sure exactly what it's trying to tell me, but I feel like part of it is saying "slow down." So maybe it's best to listen to it this time.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->
