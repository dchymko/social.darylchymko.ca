I know weâre under more restrictions than usual these days, and staying active is important for our mental and physical health. But letâs remember to be gentle on the trails as they come out from under a record snowfall this winter. Our trail groups work hard,so letâs not give them extra work!  Donât hesitate to backtrack or take different trails if things get sloppy! Conditions change daily so what might be fine today wonât be tomorrow. (These photos taken from dry roads/junctions, I did not go through what is pictured)</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->'
