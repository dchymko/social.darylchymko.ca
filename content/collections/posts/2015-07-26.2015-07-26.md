He was halfway through a 6hr training run for the FatDog 120 mile trail race. We ran together for 2hrs during which I discovered he got into trail running after doing Ironman 28(!!) times. It was great to have a companion for a couple hours that was happy to share stories and impart his wisdom. Moments like that really make #trailrunning for me.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->'
