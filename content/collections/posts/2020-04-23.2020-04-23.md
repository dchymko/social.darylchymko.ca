I'm running my solo #aravaipastrong 50K adventure tomorrow in support of the Central Okanagan Foodbank. They have seen a significant  increase of requests recently and could really use extra support right now.  My goal is to raise over $2000 in just 24h and I'm asking *you* to help me do it. A not-so-anonymous donor (me) has pledged to match every donation made up to a total of $2000. So this is an opportunity for us to make a really big impact together!  I also know that not everyone is in a position to give right now, so I'm also happy to make a donation of $2 for every share, comment, and supportive text along the way.  Link to donate is on my profile, and thank you SO MUCH for your support!  I will send updates along the way.

  The @cofoodbank has seen a 27% increase in requests the past 2 weeks alone, and in that time have helped feed 780 households and 550 children. Every 1$ donated enables the Food Bank to buy $3 of food, so any donation amount helps. In other words, with the matching, your $50 donation enables them to buy $300 of food!

  My route starts and ends at my house, and will be  a fully solo and self-supported venture. It takes me though East Vernon, up the Shuswap Highlands to Becker Lake, down through Lavington, up Bluenose and returning on the backroads of Coldstream. I will cap my matched and $2 donations at $1000.... Unless another anonymous donor wants to jump in?! )</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->
