  The original plan for @pacetrailruns  Rendezvous 135 "virtual stage race" was to connect High Rim to Okanagan Highland trail to Naramata with @karaleiny and @shuswaprunner. Travel restrictions &amp; a spicy creek crossing (among other things ) led to Plan B looking like a solo fastpack endeavor. This had logistic and timing challenges that I was trying to wrangle into the perfect plan.
  Cue a random Thursday off and a "30km" run in Kal Park that ended up 43km with 1750m vertical. I didnt start that run thinking it was race time. But somewhere towards the end, I realized it sure would make for a solid Day 1 of R135. And in true Forrest Gump fashion, I just kinda kept going.

  3 days down, 1 to go.
  102 / 135km
  4400 / 5000m vertical.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->
