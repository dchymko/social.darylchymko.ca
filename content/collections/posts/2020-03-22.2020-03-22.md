Let''s remember that when times got challenging, and our ski hills and adventure parks closed, parks were still there for us to keep active and happy. They will stay open as long as we use common sense, maintain our space, and are respectful of one another. (Photo taken Mar 18,2020)</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->'
