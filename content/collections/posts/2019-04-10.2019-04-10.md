  Iâve run almost 100km in the 9 days of my little project. I feel good overall, but have heard a few warning signs from my body telling me to slow down a bit. So Iâm going to listen and add in a few more easy days. If that means I donât finish it in April, then so be it. As ultrarunners we get good (almost TOO) good at pushing through adversity and misery to achieve our goals. But the secret to long term success is to know when to push and when to yield. 
  Also:  Iâve been writing a blog post for each run with an interactive map and all the photos from that day. Thereâs also a master map of everywhere Iâve run so far. Check it out at EveryRoadVernon.ca ( link in profile)
