If it''s gonna be as cold as Winnipeg in February, that means it''s "perfect" training weather for @actifepica . Got the layers dialed in, but am having challenges keeping the toes warm. Never been an issue skiing or running. I''ve been biking in my La Sportiva Trango boots which should handle the cold? Fat bike friends, what''s the secret?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->'
