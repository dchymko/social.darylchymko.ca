Those that put their own dreams aside to ensure that future generations would have the same freedoms as they did. *pictured here is my Grandpa who sailed into the pacific &amp; thankfully returned home after the Japanese surrender. His brother Walter did not, after giving his life in Dieppe.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->'
