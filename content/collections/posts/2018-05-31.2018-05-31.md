It's a catalyst moment to not only support what we do every day but to connect to each other. Not just about transforming tech into something more useful. But how do we transform how we *interact* with each other?

  Look at technology as a way to connect to other human beings. Keep humanity at the top of the list.

  On diversity:

  There are many women and people of colors in these positions not because of of their diversity but because they are capable. 
  If you are asking people "how is it to be (a female/ person of colour, etc) at (company/organization with latest scandal)".. then you need to ask the questions to those who are *being that every day*" Embrace the differences between us, we often surround ourselves only with people that we share same stories, religion, friends with "Don't apologize or be quiet about your differences." "Fear pushes us to be better"
