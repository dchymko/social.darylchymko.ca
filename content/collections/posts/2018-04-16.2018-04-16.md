Unfortunately my phone died a rainy death minutes after so I have no photos, just the fond memories!

  So much love and thanks and to:
  @garyrobbins and the whole @diezvista volunteer team for the amazing course and support along the way.

  New running buddy @karaleiny for sticking through 80+ km of highs and lows with me, especially crossing the final ridge in the dark &amp; pouring rain. We made it!

  The entire Bush Babes crew including @bush_babe_ @adaminvernon
  @sarahpurslow @randidelis for hi-5s along the way and enduring 2h of rain at the finish waiting for me to come in. 
  My better half @charsutt for the encouraging messages along the way and putting up with this crazy hobby of mine.

  Congrats to everyone who ran the 50/100k, y'all did an incredible thing this weekend!

  Full race post to come soon but for now I'm going to spend a few days napping and eating cheeseburgers.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->
