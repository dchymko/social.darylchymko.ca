  I'm not going to lie, this summer was challenging. A sick family member, grueling application process for a new job, my own mental health challenges and the smokiest summer on record left me 3 for 3 in missed races. This is the weekend I was supposed to run a 100miler 
  It left me feeling a bit bummed out, especially after the strong start to my running year finishing the Diez100 in April.

  So late Friday night I said "F this" and signed up for the Dirty Feet Sun Peaks 21k to break the cycle. 
  Buuuut Murphy's law came into effect on the way to the race, I  had some mechanical issues and also realized I forgot my running pack. But what else is there to do but just roll with it? I showed up at the start line 110% ready to run my heart out. 
  I pushed hard, kept a smile on my face, and started picking off runners one by one. I was completely in zone and ran in "one gear all day long" smashing my 21k PR by a full 10 minutes. 
  More importantly though, I feel back in my game and realized there's a few more "last minute" races yet to do this year.

  Footnote: I could have taken another 5 minutes off my time if I had made better dinner choices the night before #tmi
