It was on snowshoes with a snowboard strapped to my pack and was a total disaster coming down. (Iâm a horrible snowboarder.) But for some reason I was hooked and got proper touring gear shortly after.  Iâve been up Zoa every single year since then and today was one of the best days ever. We explored the entire northeast face and did 1300m vertical which would have impossible in that first year. Days like today are totally worth the 6 hours of driving ð
