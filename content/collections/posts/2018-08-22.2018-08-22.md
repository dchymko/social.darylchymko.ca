I certainly had no idea what to expect before heading there last August. But having gone two years in a row, I know of no other festival or event like it. Sure there's music &amp; art,  food &amp; drink just like many other festivals. But Ponderosa is just.. so much more than that, and you kind of have to be there to understand. The vibe is more like a gathering of new friends and old instead of  a crowded, sponsor-heavy, commercialized operation placing profit and ego over art. It's full of kids, families, people from the city, folks from the country, late night partiers, people that go to bed early, and everything in between. Everyone co-exists and is on the same level. There's no over-priced beer, entitled artists, drama, bros, excessive sponsors, or up-sells at every corner. 
  But sadly this may have been Ponderosa's last year, as for some reason, word of it's awesomeness hasn't spread as far as it needs to. (Sometimes you don't know what you have until it's gone.) So I'm here calling on you to jump in with both feet if and when it springs up again. If you love the idea of live music in a chill setting in a beautiful part of BC, then get involved. Buy your ticket, spread the word, share on your channels, volunteer, etc. And if you want to help out in the interim to increase the chances of it happening again, make a donation to their GoFundMe.

  Hope to see y'all there next year</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->
