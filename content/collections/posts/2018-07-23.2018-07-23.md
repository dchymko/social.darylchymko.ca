  The "big" peak I pan right to is Old Glory mtn, where the summit photo is taken from.

  This was a few hours into the race while I was still feeling 100%. The second half brought me minor stomach problems + some lingering issues from my ankle sprain earlier this year. Dialed things back to keep it fun and enjoyable, which left a bit of room to rally back at the end. Really pleased with my time all things considered, and had a blast out there.

  Btw, The videos and photos do not do this area Justice. If you haven't been, make a point of riding or hiking the Seven Summits trail asap.
