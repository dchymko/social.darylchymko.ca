                      <!-- /wp:video --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Physically distanced trail maintenance in Larch Hills! A record snowfall this winter combined with the recent closure of BC Rec sites means thereâs lots of work to be done out there. This particular section of Ridge Run took @shuswaprunner and I about an hour to clear, and altogether we spent 3h to clear 3km of trail. If you can lend a hand to one of your local trail associations, they would probably love the help right now!</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->
