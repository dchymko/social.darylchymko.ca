I actually dislike the term "peak-bagging" or "conquered the mountain" when talking about alpine persuits. You can conquer your *own* fears or limits, but don''t mistakenly think you conquered nature itself. Preparation, training, and common sense make a huge difference, but the wilderness is the boss. The mountains will always have the final say.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->'
