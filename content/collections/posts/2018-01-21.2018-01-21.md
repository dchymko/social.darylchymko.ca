Icy hills and crunchy snow took a real toll on the lower legs and stabilization muscles.

  But I finished all 56km of it!

  There was a point during the "trough of discomfort" at km 24-33km where I really wasn't sure if I'd be able to rally through the issues I was having in my left leg. But I stopped, regrouped and decided to slow things *way* down which ended up saving my race.

  Thanks to all the volunteers and everyone that made this amazing race happen!

  To put the difficulty into perspective for my running friends: At 8:21 finishing time I was exactly in the middle. And the course "only" had 1000m elevation gain.

  Feels pretty darn good to be at week #3 of 2018 with a 50k under my belt!
