Congrats to Brian Wilson ( not on insta) with the closest guess of 275km! I have something special Iâll send your way!

  Iâve run 65km so far, which means Iâm ~23% complete( Although I estimate it will take about350km to complete with all the out-and-and-backs.) Thatâs good progress, but thereâs still a lot of road to cover. As a bonus challenge, Iâm going to get to and from my runs only by foot, bike, or bus. 
  Keep sharing your favourite spots and memories of the areas. Thatâs the best part of this project!
