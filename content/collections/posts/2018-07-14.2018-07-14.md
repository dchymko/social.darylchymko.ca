  Last major run before @brokengoat50. Needed to get some vert in the alpine &amp; the Asulkan Valley fit the bill quite nicely. Was neat to see in the summer, as I've only ever ski toured here. If you look waaaaaay down in the valley, you can see Rogers Pass visitor center, which is basically where I started. Taper starts right now!
