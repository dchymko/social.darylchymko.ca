  Day 1 Highlights and takeaways

  Ed Callum
  What makes creative people tick?

  What are the management, cultural, and organizational obstacles that block creative change?

  Creative people became uncreative over time without noticing it.

  Need to have important group discussions/ meetings with these rules and principles:
  1. Peer to peer. Everyone is equal
  2. Powerful people should not start the discussion.People come in vulnerable and it's easy to become defensive
  3. give and listen to honest notes (raw and authentic)
  4. Watch the dynamics of the room carefully. Are there a few dominators? Are certain people trying to impress?

  Failure has two meanings: it can be a powerful learning tool or can be used as a bludgeon to beat opponents. We often mix those two meanings and need to be conciously aware of when the 2nd one is occurring.

  It's easy to state your values. It hard to explain why you don't live up to them.

  Magic happens when ego disappears from the room. Ideas can come and go without people being attached to them.Â The talent is there. You just need to remove the barriers to allow the creativity to flourish. We need to make it okay to make mistakes.

  Detoxing the bro economy

  Silicon valley had a huge morality crash in 2017. Companies lost huge value (1/3rd) because of self-inflicted moral lapses. Uber was a company that couldn't stop doing bad things even when it didn't need to. A wave of toxic masculinity is going through our culture that recently originated from Silicon Valley.

  How do we fix it?

  1) Need to move away from the ad-based business model. Get back to selling people things of value that they paid money for.
  2) companies need a moral backbone and should stop chasing the momentum
  3) Diversity is the easiest way to move things forward

  The problem with the tech industry isn't getting more women interested. Problem is they get *driven out* of the industry.

  White males: examine your biases. "Men have a responsibility to speak up on ways women and people of colour can't"</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->
