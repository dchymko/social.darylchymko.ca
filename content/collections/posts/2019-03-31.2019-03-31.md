  I surprised to see how far spread out Vernon is. City limits include @predatorridge, Ellison, The Foothills, Bella Vista, and parts of Middleton Mountain. 
  Looking forward to seeing all corners of this place I call home. 
  So any guesses as to the total distance* of all the roads in Vernon? Iâll announce it at the end of the week! Hint: itâs less than 1000km. *public roads within city limits. Does not include alleyways. Both directions of a single road are only counted once. âAs-builtâ map courtesy of the City Of Vernon</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->
