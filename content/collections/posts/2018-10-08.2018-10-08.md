I'll spare the details, but the last three months aren't something our family would be eager to go through again. But thanks to advances in medical research, and a great care team @albertacancer, we look forward to spending many more Thanksgiving holidays together.

  Also, pictured is the bench in Carlisle Community dedicated to dad for his years of volunteer service. I'm thankful to all the volunteers in our community and around the world who selflessly give their time to make the world a better place.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->
