  Tonightâs run was on the roads surrounding Vernon Secondary School. Fun fact: In August 2016, the school was used as a film set for the Vampire-themed movie âDrink, slay, love.â Itâs described as:âabout a typical 16-year-old vampire named Pearl who is fond of blood, allergic to sunlight and generally pretty evil, until a unicorn stabs her through the heart with his horn.â
  Yup, sounds like your typical teenagers! Fortunately I did not come across any vampires during my run.
