Todayâs was an exercise in strengthening my mental muscles. The last few races Iâve gotten a bit too caught up in my progress along the way, obsessing over my time and constantly âdoing the mathâ... Often pushing myself beyond my physical capabilities resulting in repercussions. This time I chilled out, ignored my watch and just ran however I felt like. The result was one of the funnest races Iâve done in a long time. It made for a more enjoyable outdoor experience which is why I started doing theses runs in the first place. 
  Thanks to the @pacetrailruns team, the many volunteers, and @redresort for yet another stellar event. It just gets better every year!

  Now to eat all the food and drink all the beers!</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->
