Brr, it's the worst, right? 
  It doesnât have to be!

  Here's five reasons why embracing it sets you up for success during the summer:
  1. Free stability training. Every step you take on snow strengths your stabilization muscles in your feet and lower legs. And guess what? More stable legs in the summer = less injuries = more fun and less time sitting on the couch all busted up.
  2. Increased resilience in unfavorable conditions &amp; adversity. You never know what race day weather will throw your way. The more you practice you have enduring hardships and building up your mental stamina, the less likely you'll DNF (and the more fun you'll have)
  3. No bugs! Or snakes! Or bears! Or crowded trails! Or full trailhead parking lots!
  4. Free speed training. You're going to feel like a rocket on all your favorite trails when the snow no longer holds you back. It's like free PRs all through May and June!
  5. So many great activities that make you a better runner. XC skiing. Ski touring. Many (most) of the top ultrarunners in the world spent a tonne  of time in the winter months on skis. (Hint: Go take a peek at how @kilianjornet is training right now) I know running is your "favourite", but there's a lot to gain in embracing the options. 
  That last one is a big one. If you don't embrace #5, you're probably going to be miserable for 4-5 months of the year, every year for the rest of eternity (or until you move somewhere warmer whichever comes first)
  I'm not saying you have to love winter. But there's more value to it than people give it credit.
