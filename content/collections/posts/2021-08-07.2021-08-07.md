Thanks to all who checked in and made generous offers for assistance. (Edit: it's now been rescinded, but we're still prepared to go on a moments notice.)
  Mainly I want to say a big thank you the entire BCWS and first responders who have been battling an absolute insane fire season in BC. This fire is only one of 1400+ covering 6000+ sq km this season, and IMO you've done an immense job protecting people and property in the face of that. THANK YOU for your tireless efforts!
  Its a stressful situation for many buts lets respond with patience, kindness and commuity through this!</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->
