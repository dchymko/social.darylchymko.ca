It's been great to connect with so many people and communities on there, but is it worth the (ever increasing) ads and addictive nature of it? I decided to cap the time and attention I spent, by logging out of the app and only logging back in once a day. That way there was no temptation to do quick check-ins when I had 2 or 3 minutes to spare. It was weird at first, but I quickly filled that void with things like reading books and listening to (more) podcasts. In the past month I've read 4(!!) books which is more than I usually read each year. I also created a new home for my photos and experiences on a domain I've been sitting on for over a decade. While I don't necessarily want to quit the Instagram community like I did for Facebook (best decision ever), I'd like to think about how to grow the same sort of thing outside of it.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->"
