I need your help. In just over a month a few of us are running out @pacetrailruns Rendezvous route from Kal to Penticton. My goal until then is to recon/clear as much of the High Rim and Okanagan Highlands trail as possible. Basically everything from Kal tower to Little White. If you find yourself on these trails in the next few weeks, I''d love a trail report especially if you come across major obstacles. I''ll also post when/where I''m clearing if you want to join in on the fun ð ð</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->'
