  It's like a really shitty roller coaster ride.

  If you've never experienced deep depression (or grief), it might be hard to understand from the outside. For me, it's like a cloud has rolled over and everything seems "different". Even walking into my house or lying down in my bed feels like a foreign place. My mind is constantly occupied by thoughts I have no control over. I'll have brief moments where regain some control but they often leave as quickly as they arrive. I've compared it being in a raft on a turbulent river and you lost your oars. The best you can do is hang on for dear life, and the more you try to fight it, the worse it gets, and the more you realize you are powerless. The only power you really have is to trust that you will make it out the other end okay, just like every time before.

  The irony of my anxiety and depression is that it's fed by the very traits that I consider my "superpowers": my ability to hyper-focus, and to think outside the "normal" thought process. This is both a blessing and a curse, depending on the context. In the good times it makes me a great problem solver, and in the worst times it's a downward spiral of uncontrollable worry and sadness.  The best I can do is be thankful for it in the good times, and tolerate it in the bad.

  Just know that sometimes it's okay to be not okay.

  Despite all the progress we've made in talking more openly about these conditions, many still struggle in silence.  There is still much shame around it, I feel it every time I go through it. Just know that you are not alone, and if we're being honest, it might get worse before it gets better. But you need to trust that it will all be okay.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->
