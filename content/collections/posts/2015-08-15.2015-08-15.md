You held strong in the transition from pavement to trails, running on terrain you were never designed for. Don''t look at the Ultra Cardiacs as your replacement, instead as younger family members who will continue your legacy. When we cross the finish line at your final race in Revy tomorrow, all the cheering will be for you.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->'
