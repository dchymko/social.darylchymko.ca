  Social media, and Instagram in particular seems to encourage a highly curated &amp; filtered view of life to the point of perfection. If you ask me, we're filtering out some of the most interesting and important stuff. So why don't we all post more raw moments, mistakes, failures, behind the scenes and works-in-progress. Surely, I can't be the only one who finds that stuff way more interesting?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->
