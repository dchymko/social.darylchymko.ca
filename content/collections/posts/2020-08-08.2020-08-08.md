                      <!-- /wp:video --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>With a couple of â4x4 requiredâ roads coming up in BranVan's future, I wanted to get a better feel for how it handled in the steep, loose and twisty stuff. Verdict: It feels much more capable than my 2WD sprinter did, especially on the ups. With a bit of practice and awareness of the low spots, it should definitely go many places a cargo van has no business being :)</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->
