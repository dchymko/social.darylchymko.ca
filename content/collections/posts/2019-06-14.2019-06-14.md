  Iâm about to embark on a 144km Ultra from Lisbon to FÃ¡tima on the Caminho do Tejo. Itâs part of the pilgrimage path many have taken to learn, reflect and grow. It will be a real stretch to complete, but Iâm sure no matter the outcome, I'll have an adventure. Iâll post updates to my site and there is a live tracker there. http://getoutside.ca/live (also in my profile). My local mobile number is also there if you want to sent good vibes. Vamos!</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->
