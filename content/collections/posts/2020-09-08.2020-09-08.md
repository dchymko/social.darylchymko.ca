Howabout routes that involve little to no trail but maximum views and adventure (and maybe a bit of bushwacking)? I have a couple fun objectives in the Monashees that Iâm hoping to find 1-2 others to join me on. Misery (I mean adventure) is always better shared. 
  1. Joss mtn E trailhead to W trailhead. (Day trip) 
  2. Twin lakes to Mt Severide and back 
  3. Tsius to Joss Mtn traverse, down to Greenbush lake and back. 
  (Ranked in increasing misery-index)

  Ideally these would be fastpack overnighters but could also be planned as long days. 

  I donât have a specific timeframe, weekdays are a possibility. Also open to other bad ideas too.
