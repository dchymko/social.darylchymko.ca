Many years ago my grandpa called us from Pick your part on Christmas Eve to come help him pull an engine out of a K-car. We never did get it fully out and when we went back the next day they were open, someone had taken it.

  Anyway, you'll be glad to know that this 14x14 hole I cut in the roof is now filled with the most beautiful roof fan you ever did see. #sprintervanconversion</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->
