  1) I joined the Canadian Military when I was 16. I also left the Canadian Military when I was 16 (that's a story for over a beer)
  2) I survived a plane crash when I was 16. I was also the pilot at the time (thats a story for over *several* beers)
  3) I haven't been in a hospital (as an inpatient) since the day I was born,
  4) I grew up in Edmonton, but in 2005 packed up all my stuff and moved to the Okanagan
  5) I'm a freelance developer and have worked mainly with remote teams around the globe. I like that I can work anywhere but the trade-off is that the start and end of my work day sometimes gets blurry.
  6) I've dealt with depression and anxiety my entire life, but am "high functioning". Exercise, counseling &amp; meditation have made a huge difference.
  7) I'm a minimalist. I own the least possessions now than I have ever have, but I am the happiest for it. Too many people in this world fill voids in their lives with physical items.
  8) If you had told me a year ago I'd be drinking kombucha and doing yoga every day, I would have called you a crazy person. But here we are, Namaste.
  9) I've run several half marathons and trail races dressed up as a hot dog.
  10) I started trail running in 2014, and in April this year ran a 100k race. Next up: 100-miler in September. 
  Now it's your turn! Comment below or tag me in your post.
