Beautiful but deadly (to backcountry enthusiasts). Formed on cold, clear nights, the problem starts to occur as the next snowfalls start to pile up on top. The fragility and orientation of the crystals prevent a strong bond between the old snow and new snow. The best analogy I''ve heard is they are like dominos, holding up until the instant there is any movement (like a skier or snowmobile) then all fall over taking the layers above with them. This is one of the main reasons we dig snow pits, to find and test these layers before skiing on them.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->'
