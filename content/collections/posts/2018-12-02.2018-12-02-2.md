  I'm no stranger to them, but yesterday is the first time I've turned around mid-course instead of bailing at the next aid station. I was at the top of this hill (27km) and had been fighting a total lack of energy from sickness I had picked up a few days prior.  I knew that both only was a finish unlikely, but that I was pushing myself into the red zone of personal safety/health. I've finished a 50 miler while battling a chest cold, but this was an entirely different beast. In hindsight, I probably should have dropped down a distance or two at registration. So yes, the dreaded man cold did me in ð. On the positive side, I got to meet some really nice people along the way, and saw some amazing views (after enduring sideways rain in 60k+ winds for the first 2 hours. Coastal England weather does NOT mess around). Unfortunately I have no photos to share, since the rain also did my phone in*. There's unfinished business between me and the Jurassic coast, so I'm sure I'll be back! *Photo shamelessly pilfered from Sam Stagersson
