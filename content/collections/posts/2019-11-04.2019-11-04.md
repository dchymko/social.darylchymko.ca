Like any good adventure, things quickly got dodgy down a steep icy hill and we had to abort mission. Neither of us were crazy about the âType 2 sh*tshowâ that was bound to occur if we continued down. We walked down to the lake, and as the sun reflected on the ice, we reflected on our questionable choices thus far. Time to retreat! Thankfully I had already put the tire chains on, but turning a cargo van around on a tight trail is no easy task( who drives a cargo van down snowy quad trails, honestly). Some heavy throttle + channeling my off-roading skills from a decade ago resulted some precarious angles and tires (several feet!) in the air,but thankfully the rubber side stayed down and I got back up the hill. Unfortunately thereâs no video or photo evidence of these shenanigans (we were focused on extracting ourselves), but @craigscampbell can vouch for them. Wisely we then relocated to a more reasonable camp spot to celebrate our victory  in the face of questionable decisions.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->'
