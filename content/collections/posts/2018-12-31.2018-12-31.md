Drill a pilot hole and stick the saw blade through. You're committed now! Fire up the jigsaw and go to town. Use painters tape or pads on the bottom of the saw to prevent scratching. Oh and you're going to want to put something like poly or cardboard behind where you're cutting because metal shavings will go everywhere. Cut from the bottom up on both sides and finish the cut at the top. The metal cutout will be heavier than you expect. Remove it and gaze upon the spectacle of the giant hole you have just cut in your very expensive German automobile.

  Test fit the window and make any adjustments. Remember you can't uncut so hopefully your measurements were right. Now cut the other side out. Once that's done admire the cross breeze for a moment before exclaiming "Oh God, what have I done?!". The cut edges will be pretty rough, so file them down and paint them with a primer. (I used grey Rust Check)

  Okay the scary part is done, now we should close things up. Have an assistant hold the window in place while you screw on the flange from the inside. Tighten the screws a bit at a time working opposite sides in a zig zag fashion. Tell your assistant to let go of the window outside. Does it stay in? Hooray, you did it!
