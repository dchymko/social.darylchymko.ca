During April, Iâm going to run all the roads in Vernon BC to get a little more familiar with all the corners of this great little town. Along the way Iâll share some fun facts, hidden gems and forgotten history. You can participate by sharing your favourite spots/memories, or even run some of with me. Who knows, there may even be prizes ân free stuff. 
  So for practice before things get going... Do you recognize this area I was in today? (I think this should be an easy one. )

  Also, thanks to @rickeygates for the original idea. He recently ran all 1100 miles of San Francisco in just 46 days!! .
