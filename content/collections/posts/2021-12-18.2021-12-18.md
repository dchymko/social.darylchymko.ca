Short for "Ski Mountaineering", Skimo is a sport where you travel uphill using a combination of climbing skins and bootpacking (hiking), then switch to downhill mode and straight-line to the bottom. This particular race was a timed event, and I was stoked to get eight laps in. As you can see from the "after" photo, it was all smiles at the end of the 2 hours! Shout-out to @skiuphill.ca and @skimo_alberta for putting on such a welcoming race. It was fantastic to see such a wide variety of ages and abilities all trying their hardest side-by-side. Thanks also to my coach @kyleektoth for all the guidance &amp; support for this new-to-me sport, I'm hooked! And a big thank you to all the sponsors including @fischerski who supplied the Traverse ski boots that I won!
