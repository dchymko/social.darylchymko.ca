Snow, sun,  vague trails, route-finding, trail-clearing, bushwacking and crazy quad trail access at the start. Definitely not your typical trail run. But it was a load of fun with smiles the whole way, and we made it all the way to Little White. Nice to finally run this portion after attempts dating all the way back to 2006. More on that later, its nap time now!</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->'
