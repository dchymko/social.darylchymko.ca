  There are two things you've heard about how we can beat this thing: "Stay home" and "keep 2m+ from others". Risks in general (and pandemics as we're finding out) are usually exponential,in other words multiply each other. This is why in Backcountry skiing we look at risk reduction in absolutely *every* single detail. Every small decision counts, and two bad decisions compound into a scenario with many times the risk. 
  Here's a quick example in running terms:  Lets say you and a friend go running on Monday (at 2m distance, "Look everyone we took a selfie to prove it!"). Then on Tuesday you each run with a different friend.  And those friends run the next day with (only one!) other friend. By the end of 5 days, these activities with "just one" friend have expanded into 162 contacts. Now weâre understanding why many health restrictions are focused on group size. Two people each time, 162 contacts in just five days!  So the closer you keep contacts to zero (the ideal), the better.

  This is why if you choose to recreate outdoors,its very important to keep BOTH the above rules in mind, as they multiply each other. Here are my interpretations:

  Stay at home - Limit the number of days/times you head out , especially if it's around other people/friends. Limit the number of different people you do recreate with, now is probably not the time to catch up with a different person each time.  Health officials in my area have all but said not to socialize or recreate with people you donât live with. 
  Keep 2M - Find safe ways to recreate, away from as many people as possible. Choose roads, trails, parks that are less busy, *even* if people are &gt;2m away from you. Go explore âboringâ road systems away from the busy urban trailsystems. The 2m guideline IMO was more for passing contact, not endured contact. If you are recreating in the same direction as someone else keep as much distance as possible.

  Be smart, be safe, and have fun out there! *It's been 38 days since I last recreated with humans, seen in this photo</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->
